						Disbursement-Linked Result 2: Assessing Student Learning Outcomes
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							To ensure continuous improvement, teachers conduct termly
							assessments for at least 80% of their students annually. These
							assessments, aligned with the curriculum, enable teachers to gauge
							students' progress and adjust their teaching accordingly. Our
							digital platform facilitates the grading and analysis of
							assessment results, providing valuable insights for teachers and
							School Pedagogical Support Officers (SPSOs) to enhance classroom
							instruction. By implementing this program, we aim to achieve the
							following outcomes and impacts: Increased number of students
							benefiting from effective teaching practices.
						</li>
						<li>
							Regular student assessments that inform teaching adjustments and
							improvement.
						</li>
						<li>
							Individualized reports provided to teachers by SPSOs, based on
							coaching interactions and assessment results, guiding them to
							enhance their teaching practice.
