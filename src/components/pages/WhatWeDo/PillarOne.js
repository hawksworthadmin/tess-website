					<ul>
						<li>
							We aim to improve access to education for underserved communities
							by providing grants to School-Based Management Committees (SBMCs)
							through the State Universal Basic Education Board (SUBEB). The
							grants will be used to extend existing primary schools into junior
							secondary schools, add new classroom blocks, renovate primary
							school buildings, and provide separate WASH facilities for girls.
							We will measure success by the number of male and female students
							gaining access to schools with improved learning conditions. This
							initiative includes conducting infrastructure audits, prioritizing
							schools with the highest deficits, and allocating resources
							accordingly. By addressing infrastructure needs, we promote
							equitable access to basic education and create better learning
							environments for students.
